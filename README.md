# 🔐 Secure EC2 Backup Automation Portal with Flask & S3

This is a Flask-based web dashboard hosted on an AWS EC2 instance that automates secure file backups to Amazon S3. It follows AWS best practices by using IAM roles, KMS encryption, CloudWatch monitoring, and SNS notifications for real-time backup visibility and alerting.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask, Boto3
- **Cloud Services:** AWS EC2, S3, IAM, KMS, SNS, CloudWatch
- **Automation:** Cron Jobs (for scheduled backups)
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch Logs, Alarms, SNS

## ✅ Features

- Web-based interface to trigger and manage file backups
- S3 bucket integration with server-side encryption (SSE-KMS)
- IAM roles used for secure, credential-free access to S3
- Real-time monitoring via CloudWatch (Logs + Alarms)
- Email/SMS notifications using Amazon SNS for backup success/failure
- Secure architecture with role-based access and logging
